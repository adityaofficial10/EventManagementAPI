## EventManagementAPI

#Introduction: \

This is a basic REST API which allows the user to handle and manipulate events. This can be deployed with a frontend to fetch records, create new users and events, list the events, waitlists for an event,etc... \
It has seven routes:  \
1. Create Event. \
2. Delete Event. \
3. List upcoming events. \
4. Create User. \
5. Delete User. \
6. Attend Event (for a logged in user).  \
7. Get Attendees of an event.  \

#Setup Instructions:  \

1.Clone this repository on your system.  \
2.Check out the package.json file and first install node and run npm install from the command line.This will install the dependencies.  \
3.Run npm start from the command line and server starts on the port 3000.(If you want to change this, create a dot.env file and create a variable PORT and assign it the value. \

The best way to test this is using Postman and making API calls while going through the documentation.
